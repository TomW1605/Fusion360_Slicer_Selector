A simple python app that you can set as a slicer in Fusion 360. When it is run from the Make tool by Fusion 360 it will open a window and ask what slicer you want to use.

This can be useful if you have different slicers for different printers or like to use a particular slicer for different types of models.

It includes a config window to where you can add, edit and delete slicers from the list.
